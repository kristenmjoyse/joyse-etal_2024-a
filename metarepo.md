## Abstract
Geologic reconstructions of overwash events can extend storm records beyond the brief instrumental record. However, the return periods of storms calculated from geologic records alone may underestimate the frequency of events given the preservation bias of geologic records. Here, we compare a geologic reconstruction of storm activity from a salt marsh in New Jersey to two neighboring instrumental records at the Sandy Hook and the Battery tide gauges. Eight overwash deposits were identified within the marsh’s stratigraphy by their fan-shaped morphology and coarser mean grain size (3.6 ± 0.7 φ) compared to autochthonous sediments they were embedded in (5.6 ± 0.8 φ). We used an age-depth model based on modern chronohorizons and three radiocarbon dates to provide age-constraints for the overwash deposits. Seven of the overwash deposits were attributed to historical storms, including the youngest overwash deposit from Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The four youngest overwash deposits overlap with instrumental records. In contrast, the Sandy Hook and Battery tide gauges recorded eight and eleven extreme water levels above the 10 % annual expected probability (AEP) of exceedance level, respectively between 1932/1920 to present. The geologic record in northern New Jersey, therefore, has a 36 to 50 % preservation potential of capturing extreme water levels above the 10 % AEP level.
